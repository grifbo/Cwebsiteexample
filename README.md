# Cwebsiteexample

This is a C# website that I worked on as my capstone group project with three others

The javascript, CSS, and the SQL was not done by me. The work I did was C# code and the HTML connected to it. 

Included the extra code to show how it works with the code I wrote. 

The files that I wrote are in the Controllers, models, and views folder.
